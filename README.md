This script counts the frequency of all characters from each file with a given file_extension in the /corpus director (and its subdirectories).

Motivation: To design an ergonomic keyboard layout for code characters, optimized for the languages I use most often (Swift, Ruby, and Javascript).

To use:
* Designate the file_extension on the first line of char_count.rb
* Run the script in the terminal
