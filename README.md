This script counts the frequency of all characters from each file with a given file_extension in the /corpus directory (and its subdirectories).

Motivation: To design an ergonomic keyboard layout for code characters, optimized for the languages I use most often (Swift, Ruby, and Javascript).

To use:
* Designate the `file_extensions` on the first line of `char_count.rb`
* Add or remove characters (and character sets) to the `blacklist` array[]
* Run the script in the terminal
